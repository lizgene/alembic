I like to fish. I love to swim. I couldn’t live without a dog. What else would you like to know about me? I like to make people laugh and smile. I hope to make participants out of spectators. What do you call a fairy that never takes a bath? Stinkerbell!

I have always been a lover of movement. My mom says that at age four I was marching with the bands on television. My elementary school years were filled with dancing down hallways and putting on plays for neighbor kids. I learned to do cartwheels in the aisles of grocery stores. I started formal dance training at the age of 12 and as I was preparing for college dance programs realized I was too short for the life of a ballerina, not to mention my difficulty doing triple turns. 
My dance journey shifted to the world of modern dance and I have never looked back. 
During the summer of 1978, having recently moved to Fort Wayne, IN, I befriended several women who shared my love of dance and together we created the Fort Wayne Dance Collective, which still thrives.

I enjoyed a career that brought me in touch with many forms of movement and theatre including contact improvisation, the Bartenieff Movement Fundamentals®, the Feldenkrais Method®, Action Theatre, Music Together®, and studied with notable artists Joe Goode, Remy Charlip, Ruth Zaporah and many more. 
My 37 years as Artistic Director of the Fort Wayne Dance Collective honed my skills as a teacher, choreographer, performer, director, and administrator. 

I left my administrative position at the Fort Wayne Dance Collective in 2015 which coincided with my graduation from the Seattle Eastside Feldenkrais® Training. Since then, I continue to teach a variety of classes as well as focusing on my profession as a Feldenkrais® Practitioner. I am currently enrolled as a Teacher in Training for Bones for Life® as administrated through Future Life Now.
