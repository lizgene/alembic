It all began with Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. He was a scientific engineer by trade and judo master by training. He had long suffered issues with his knees, but was intent on avoiding invasive options like surgery. 

He began to study anatomical structure, and many disciplines related to movement and human behavior, such as yoga, the martial arts, psychology, and education, especially the work of Jean Piaget. 

What drew him in the most was the weight-bearing and shock-absorbing function of the skeletal system in relationship to gravity. He found that by gently stimulating the bones and joints and their connection through the spinal column and
the brain, new movement patterns were possible. In other words, by learning to sense subtle differences, a person could learn to move out of pain. By engaging the brain’s ability to relearn and change, the Feldenkrais Method improves the exchange of relevant information between the nervous system and the muscles, and as a result, movement becomes more comfortable.

This process of retraining the body is called somatic education in which the Feldenkrais Method® is rooted. By expanding the self-image through precise movement sequences, attention is brought to parts of the self that are not functioning efficiently. You can become more aware of your habitual neuromuscular patterns and rigidities and will be able to expand your options for moving in less painful ways. 

The benefits of the Feldenkrais Method® include greater ease and range of motion, improved flexibility and coordination, and more efficient movement. In short, by directed attention, the Feldenkrais Method® assists you to live your life more fully, efficiently and comfortably.
