<h3 id="feldenkrais">The Feldenkrais Method</h3>

The [Feldenkrais Method®](/feldenkrais/) is a form of somatic education designed to to retrain the body to move out of pain. By expanding the self-image through precise movement sequences, attention is brought to parts of the self that are not functioning efficiently. You can become more aware of your habitual neuromuscular patterns and rigidities and will be able to expand your options for moving in less painful ways.

The benefits of the Feldenkrais Method® include greater ease and range of motion, improved flexibility and coordination, and more efficient movement. In short, by directed attention, the Feldenkrais Method® assists you to live your life more fully, efficiently and comfortably.

<h3 id="bones">Bones for Life</h3>

{% include figure.html image="/assets/images/th.jpeg" position="center" width="168" %}

I completed my Feldenkrais® training in 2015, and hungered for more! Aside from taking the four-year training all over again (really?) signing up for [Bones for Life®](http://movementintelligence.org/bones-for-life/) was a perfect fit for me. 

Ruthy Alon, one of the original 13 students of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, created this method designed to strengthen bones through movement.

When you consider that 50% of all women will experience osteoporosis in their life and that if you live long enough, everyone will experience some bone loss, this somatic method is so important and needed. It is also a wonderful alternative to taking drugs! 

Ruthy Alon designed 90 processes that involve simple to complex movements that create “biological optimism” as we inspire the skeleton to continue its work of building bone health. The processes are done standing, sitting and lying down and sometimes use simple props like towels or rolled up socks. As we progress and students become more invested, students are asked to acquire a cloth body wrap and ankle and hand weights.  Many processes also require a wall.  

As a “Teacher in Training” I will teaching classes through Zoom, which I offer to anyone interested. Hopefully I will also be teaching in person at the Fort Wayne Dance Collective. 

The Foundation for Movement Intelligence is the North American nonprofit sponsor of Ruthy Alon’s programs and requires that any student taking a Bones for Life® class complete a [“Memorandum of Understanding of Movement Intelligence” form](https://forms.gle/K6mNWwSemJ5dkFEq9).

I am so excited to start this journey with you to build a strong and stable skeleton that can serve you for the rest of your life!

<h3 id="dance">Dance for Disabilities</h3>

{% include figure.html image="/assets/images/ddd2.JPG" position="center" width="550" %}

My lifetime of teaching dance has been so enriched by my work with people with disabilities. When you consider who needs movement the most, I believe it is people who are often forgotten, who sit in the corner, who are never given a chance to show the rest of us who they really are. Dance and music provide this opportunity and it just takes a nudge and a strategy to open up their world that often stays hidden. 

I have been teaching dance and music programs for people with disabilities since 1986 through Very Special Arts of Indiana and various programs presented by the Fort Wayne Dance Collective. Residency sites include Easter Seals Arc of Northeast Indiana, Turnstone, Passages Inc. in Huntington, IN, Pathfinders Inc. in Columbia City, IN as well as through local schools. I was also a team member for the Jesters of St. Francis, a performing group of 80 individuals for three years. 

I was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by Bi-County Services in Bluffton recognizing 25 years of programming in 2018. I have created workshops that train resident artists on the integration of props, percussion instruments, art and singing to design appropriate and exciting lessons for this population. I am also certified as a Music Together® teacher. In addition, I have worked extensively in facilities that serve people with dementia, Alzheimer’s and I am certified to teach Dance for Parkinson’s Disease.  
 
My services include on-site programming as well as trainings for people interested in including dance and music for this population:

* Individual and Group Classes
* Consulting
* Resources

<h3 id="qigong">Qigong Classes</h3>

{% include figure.html image="/assets/images/taichi1.jpg" position="left" width="350" %}

When the COVID-19 pandemic first arrived in March of 2020 I knew right away it was going to be a long time. I experienced my own anxiety and knew that movement would be my personal response to getting through the long haul. I began teaching T’ai Chi on Zoom every single day. As the weeks and months went by, I started deleting certain days of the week until now it is just one time a week. After the first few months of teaching, I realized I needed new material and started seeking out more resources to inspire myself and my Zoom students. I incorporated more Qigong, added some Haiku poetry, some riddles, some narratives, some Bones for Life, some modern dance, some meditation…well, you get the picture! I’ve enjoyed this year of finding a combination of elements that helps me feel happy, strong, confidant, centered, grounded and focused. 

*You don’t need any experience to join in the class.* The directions are simple, and you can move at your own pace. You also don’t need to come to every class, just pop in when you can.

If you are able, you may make a contribution of $5 -$10 per class. I will not be keeping track. Many people make a payment after a month or so. You can do so through PayPal through my email address. If you prefer, I can give you my mailing address and you can send a check. Just ask. If you can’t pay anything that is ok too. Really.
